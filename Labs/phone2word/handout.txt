HOW TO MEMORIZE PHONE NUMBER

Problem statement: 
write a program that outputs all possible 
combinations of a phone number using the keypad digit to 
character correspondence:

Most phones have the following key to character(s) mapping:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> a,b,c
3 -> d,e,f
4 -> g,h,i
5 -> j,k,l
6 -> m,n,o
7 -> p,q,r,s
8 -> t,u,v
9 -> w,x,y,z

Which allows one to create a word instead from a sequence of numbers (phone number):

number: 865737
8 - choose V
6 - choose O
5 - choose L
7 - choose P
3 - choose E
7 - choose R

For this lab you will create a vector of all possible combinations of
characters for a given phone number.  

Note that driver uses 2 different keypad mappings.
