Write a recursive function that prints all possible subsets of a given set.
Set will be provided as an std::vector. 

Idea: assuming the size of the set is n, your recursion should be depth n. 
On level i of recursion you either "add" (first recursive call) 
or "not add" (second recursive call) the i'th item of the vector.

Set {a,b,c}:

Subsets:
                     {}                     a
                 /        \
                a           {}              b
              /   \        /   \
             ab     a     b    {}           c
            /  \   / \   / \   / \ 
           abc ab ac  a bc  b c   {}        <---- all 8 subsets
