1) add support for division and subtraction to evaluate postfix expressions
2) create function to convert infix to postfix notations


Notes:
Only single-digit numbers will be used as input, so each character is a token 
(to remove this restriction - NOT PART of this lab, one will have to use some kind of delimeter 
 in postfix notation: 12+15 --> 12;15;+)

Only 4 operators are supported +,-,*,/. All of them associate left-to-right, therefore 
the simplified algorithm from cs280 slides may be used. To support right-to-left associated 
operations ( like "+=", etc) you will need (NOT PART of this lab) complete version of Dijkstra's railroad shunting yard algorithm:
